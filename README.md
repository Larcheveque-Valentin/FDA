Functionnal Data Analysis
A simple Implementation of a new convolutional architecture for FDA Neural networks. 
Better than MLP to classify functional data.
Quicker in epoch.
The functional .py file contains every function you need to automatically compare a wide variety of models for functional classification and regression. 
The class Hyperparameters is uselefull to set up the hyper parameters as you wish and it's universal nature make it usable on different model classes.
Implemented for Gru lstm mlp TSC (the model we propose)
